# Tips & Tricks of a Power BI Premium Implementation in a Financial Institute  
For this session a basic knowledge of Power BI is assumed, there is no deep technical knowledge necessary.  
Attendees will walk away with guidelines and practical tips from a real-world implementation of Power BI (Premium) with 750+ users.  
Back to September 2016: Power BI is new, shiny and hot. It is the tool of the moment, so people cannot wait to get their hands on it.  
Fast forward 6 months, there is more traction within the business, trainings are given and workshops are held. The adoption of Power BI is growing. Some departments already use Power BI very extensively and incorporate it in their day-to-day processes. Due to this quick success there is uncertainty regarding the right support team for incidents and problems.  
Because an app workspace creates an Office 365 group with a lot of artifacts behind the scenes, the creation workflow is controlled by IT. Unfortunately this inhibits the end users.  
We require more governance, not to further bother the users, but it is essential to stay in control. Responsibilities need to be better aligned between IT and the business. And what to do with Power BI Premium?  
Throughout this session we take you along on our Power BI journey, with tips, tricks, do's and don'ts during the implementation of Power BI (Premium) at a financial institute in the Netherlands.
