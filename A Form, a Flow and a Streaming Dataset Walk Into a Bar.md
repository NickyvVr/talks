# A Form, a Flow and a Streaming Dataset Walk Into a Bar  
This is a live demo session that demonstrates the Microsoft Power Platform of products working together to create an interactive data application.

It's good to have some form of interactivity in your presentation. Whether it's by (live) polling your audience, telling a story, asking questions during your presentation or any other way to make your presentation more interactive, doesn't really matter.
The way I started doing this was by firing some questions at the audience after I introduced myself. Although that worked pretty well, I was asking closed questions with a show of hands. I did get a feel of the audience from my perspective so I know on what topics to focus on a little more in my presentation.

But as I work with the Power Platform suite of products I thought it was a good idea to use some of that Power! So in this session I will show you the following:
* Create a form with Microsoft Forms,
* Create a Power Automate flow to get the answers,
* Push them into a Power BI streaming dataset,
* And finally create a Power BI report and dashboard on that dataset to get a live view of the answers of the audience.
