# Hands-on Workshop - The Power BI Service â€“ Workspaces & Apps
In this workshop we will go through a set of actions in the Power BI Service: from publish to the service, manage access, create a dashboard, to publishing and maintaining an app.   
As a bonus we'll go through some of the Power BI Tenant settings that are worth looking at as a Power BI Administrator.
