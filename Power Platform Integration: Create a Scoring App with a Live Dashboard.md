# Power Platform Integration: Create a Scoring App with a Live Dashboard

Often during a presentation or workshop, you want to have an interactive quiz.
Maybe you've used Kahoot or any of the other platforms out there, but they rarely integrate well with our other applications. Using the Power Platform, we'll create an interactive quiz that gives you the best of all worlds.

Our goal is to create an app where attendees will answer questions and be awarded points for (partially) correct answers.
We want to have an application where we can enter the name of an attendee and their score. Ideally, we'll be showing the results using that application so there's no constant switching going on.
And, we're going to accomplish this by using 3 of the Power Platform products: Power Apps, Power Automate and Power BI.

Join this session to see how to build this solution from scratch!
