#  Write-back with Power Apps in Power BI
Have you ever wondered why you can't edit your data in Power BI like in Excel? Now you can!
Well, not directly in Power BI, but you can accomplish this with a Power App inside a Power BI report.
In this session you will learn how to create a basic Power App and how to use that in the Power Apps visual in a Power BI report. You will learn how to connect Power BI and Power Apps together to update data in a database and display the results in Power BI.
During the session, we will also run through different use cases where this can be brought to practice.
This is an intermediate (Power BI) session, so experience with Power BI is assumed, prior experience with Power Apps is not necessarily needed.
